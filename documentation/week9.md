## Overview
This week officially marked the ninth week of my internship here at CSET! Crazy how time flies!!    
This week, I focused on material for my presentation on the project I have worked on this summer. I worked on    
preparing slides for the presentation along with some basic evaluations which I did. I mostly focused on the    
presentation, receiving feedback from James and Rebecca on what to change and/or emphasis on more during the     
presentation itself.

I made various iterations to the presentation, using code snippets from the repo, as well as simplified code    
snippets I had to make on the go to illustrate certain examples. I had the presentation on Thursday of this     
week, and I think it was quite a success! It would not have been possible without all the help from Jennifer     
and other members of the data team. On the later half of the week, I focused on writing unit tests for the    
project.

One problem I ran into was pushing large files to GitHub. I tried using `git lfs` for the first time, and I      
believe I ended up messing my commit history to a point where it was just an utter mess. I reverted to an earlier    
version of the repo, losing some of the work I had already done

> **Note to self**: Learn how git resets really work. Also, learn more about git lfs in the future!
