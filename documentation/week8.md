__Tuesday__ - Evaluations of LF results         
__Wednesday__ - Working on slides for presentation            
__Thursday__ -  Attempt evaluations using keyword searches             
__Friday__ -  Reiterating slides      

## Overview
This week, I mostly focused on putting together my presentation for the project. I started the week by outlining some things which I needed to include in the presentation, then proceeded to some basic evaluations of the Label Models from the WIPO application areas. 

Evaluating the Label Models has been quite the challenge so far, especially when incorporating the keywords Jonathan highlighted. As a result of the challenges I faced, I decided to focus on the slides instead of spending too much time on the evaluations. 

This week, I also worked on a rough estimation of the class balance by using keyword frequencies in relation to the overall data corpus size. (see [class_balance_estimator.py](../weak_labeling/class_balance_estimator.py))
